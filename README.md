# Modelling the Retail System Competition
We simulated competition between various shops through cellular automata based model in MATLAB. We kept 2 parameters for each shop, location and price, which they can change to gain more customer share and profit respectively. We examined different scenarios for analysis and proposed different strategies for shops to gain more benefits.
